# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `--output_video <path>` writes the annotated video output of a video run to a
  playable file (fixed 30 fps, codec auto-selected, container inferred from the
  extension). Opt-in: build with `-DNEURIPLO_INFER_WITH_VIDEOWRITER=ON`.
  Image sources are rejected, and a writer-less build exits fast naming that
  flag; the parameter is advertised in `--capabilities` only when built in.
- `--timings_csv <path>` writes one row per inference (`frame,latency_us`) for
  a video run. The run report carries per-stage totals and throughput but not
  the distribution, so a run whose mean is fine because one slow frame was
  averaged away by four hundred quick ones is indistinguishable from a
  uniformly quick one. The file is opened before the first frame, so a run that
  cannot write its measurements fails before spending minutes producing them,
  and parent directories are created.
- `--no_display` suppresses the preview window. This is not only a convenience:
  with no `DISPLAY`, `cv::imshow` aborts the process on its Qt platform plugin,
  so before this flag a headless or benchmark run could not complete at all.
  Verified on a 404-frame 1280x720 clip through the ONNX Runtime backend --
  404 rows written and the run finished, where the same command without the
  flag dumps core.
- Machine-readable run diagnostics. Every run now writes a versioned report
  (`data/output/run_report.json`, advertised by `--capabilities` under
  `diagnostics.run_report`) carrying per-stage timings, sample/frame counts,
  throughput, and the stage a failure was attributed to
  (`configuration`, `model_load`, `source`, `preprocess`, `inference`,
  `postprocess`, `render`, `unknown`). Unmeasured values are `null` rather than
  zero, so a consumer never renders a measurement that was not taken.
  Configuration failures, which exit before anything unwinds, and backends that
  throw non-`std::exception` types are both attributed. Writing the report
  cannot change a run's outcome or exit code.
- `capabilities_schema_contract` test: `--capabilities` output is now validated
  against `docs/capabilities.schema.json`, which previously could drift from
  the emitter unnoticed.
- YOLO26 depth estimation routing. `yolo-depth`, `yolo26n-depth`, and any
  YOLO-prefixed model type containing `depth` now route to `DepthEstimation`,
  mirroring the family added in neuriplo-tasks v0.8.0. Previously these fell
  through to `Detection` and a depth model was rendered as a detector.
- `--segmentation_output` / `-so` (`mask` or `polygon`, default `mask`),
  wiring `TaskConfig::segmentation_output` from neuriplo-tasks v0.7.0. Polygon
  results are rendered as closed perimeter outlines (see Fixed below); the
  mask path is unchanged when the flag is absent.

- Server-side ensemble building blocks, ported from tritonic v0.4.0 and
  retargeted onto `kserve::ModelMetadata` / `kserve::InferOutput`:
  - `--input_mode=preprocessed|encoded-image`, `--task_model`, and
    `--postprocess_mode=cpu|gpu`, with strict guard rails (encoded-image
    needs a KServe endpoint, a task model, and `--batch=1`, and forbids
    `--input_sizes`; GPU postprocessing requires encoded-image).
  - `app/inc/EncodedImage.hpp`: JPEG dimension reader, encoded-image request
    builder, and validation of the ensemble against the inner task model.
  - `app/inc/KserveEnvelope.hpp`: decoders for the detection, packed-mask, and
    polygon envelopes back into neuriplo-tasks results, including rejection of
    a truncated offset array on a detection-free frame.

  - Wired through the image and video paths in `CLICommands.cpp`: a single
    `inferFrame` helper selects local preprocessing, server-side preprocessing,
    or server-side pre- and postprocessing. Still images send their original
    file bytes untouched; video frames are re-encoded per frame.
  - The task is built from the inner model's metadata in encoded-image mode,
    fetched over a second client, since the ensemble's own metadata only
    describes an encoded image.

- `--task_model_version` (default `1`): the inner model's version,
  independent of the ensemble's own `--kserve_model_version`, since a graph
  may reference a different inner version.

### Fixed
- A model's advertised input datatypes now reach preprocessing instead of the
  first input being forced to `Float32` (#44). Over KServe, `Float32` bytes were
  labelled with whatever datatype the server advertised, so a `UINT8`, `INT8`,
  or `BOOL` input was rejected or misread by the server. Now an image input
  advertised as `UINT8` receives raw 0–255 pixels and runs; an image input whose
  datatype preprocessing cannot produce (`INT8`, `BOOL`, `INT64`, `FP16`, ...)
  fails at pipeline setup with an error naming the input, its datatype, and
  `--input_mode=encoded-image` as the way out; and `KserveEngine` refuses any
  input whose byte count does not fit its advertised datatype and shape before
  sending the request. `encoded-image` mode is unaffected. The KServe adapter
  also records each input and output datatype in `InferenceMetadata`, and the
  KServe-only contract gains `LayerInfo::datatype`.
- Video FPS overlay no longer divides by zero. It measured in whole
  milliseconds, so any inference faster than 1 ms truncated to zero and the
  overlay reported `inf` -- on exactly the fast backends worth measuring. The
  measurement is now in microseconds.
- Polygon segmentation rendering filled the exteriors and alpha-blended them,
  which is visually indistinguishable from the mask overlay and never drew the
  perimeter. Polygon results now stroke closed outline contours only
  (exteriors thickness 2, holes 1, anti-aliased).
- `--postprocess_mode=gpu` silently fell back to client-side CPU
  postprocessing when the model's metadata declared no decoded envelope,
  quietly changing execution placement. It is now a configuration error
  naming the model and pointing at `--postprocess_mode=cpu`.
- Warmup and benchmark bypassed the configured transport: both preprocessed
  locally and sent a dense float tensor even in encoded-image mode, where the
  server expects a UINT8 IMAGE. Both now route through the same per-frame
  path as normal inference.
- KServe requests sent the model's declared input shape verbatim, so a model
  with a dynamic (negative) dimension produced an invalid request. The extent
  is now derived from the payload when exactly one axis is dynamic. Encoded
  images are the first inputs to need it: their byte length varies per request.
- Decoded mask envelopes produced no visible masks. The envelope carries
  box-sized masks, and the renderer resizes whatever image it is given to the
  frame, so a box-sized mask was stretched across the entire picture. Masks are
  now expanded into a frame-sized image at the detection's box origin, matching
  what the local postprocessor produces.

### Changed
- Pinned `neuriplo` to `v0.9.1` (was `v0.8.0`). Its `LayerInfo::datatype` carries
  the input datatypes the #44 fix reads, and it advertises `INT8` / `BOOL` DALI
  inputs instead of reporting them as `Float32`. neuriplo 0.9.0 also changed two
  consumer contracts — TensorRT reports batch-inclusive shapes, and public headers
  no longer include OpenCV transitively; this app builds and passes its full test
  suite against the new pin.
- Pinned `neuriplo-tasks` to `v0.8.2` (was `v0.8.0`), which carries the image-input
  pixel-type handling the #44 fix depends on (`Preprocessor::applyImageInputType`,
  `isImageInputShape`). The pin also pulls in the `v0.8.1` preprocessing changes:
  RT-DETR / RT-DETRv2 / D-FINE / DEIM no longer apply ImageNet mean/std
  normalization, and YOLO NMS-free detection now detects normalized vs
  input-pixel coordinates. Detector outputs on those model types change as a
  result of the pin.
- The README is now a plug-and-play entry point — a Docker quickstart and a
  build-from-source quickstart, both run as written on Ubuntu 24.04 with ONNX
  Runtime, plus platform support — and links to new user guides instead of
  embedding reference material (#38, #39). `docs/Usage.md` holds the full CLI
  reference, examples, `--capabilities`, and the run report, and now covers flags
  the README never listed (`--no_display`, `--timings_csv`, `--num_frames`,
  `--mmproj`, `--bert_tokenizer_vocab`, `--task_model_version`).
  `docs/Deployment.md` covers platforms, every backend and Docker image, GPU
  runs, the end-to-end presets, native builds, and build options. The KServe
  flags moved to `docs/KserveRuntime.md`, which also corrects the documented
  `--kserve_transport` default to `grpc` (HTTP in builds without gRPC).
- `scripts/sync_supported_model_types.py` writes only
  `docs/generated/supported-model-types.md`; the README links to it instead of
  embedding the list. Relative links in the upstream block are rewritten to
  absolute neuriplo-tasks URLs, fixing a broken segmentation-outputs link.
- `.dockerignore` excludes `models/`, `environments/`, and `build-*/`: after an
  end-to-end preset run they sent gigabytes of host artifacts to every
  `docker build`.
- Pinned `videocapture` to `v0.5.0` (was `v0.4.0`), which adds the optional
  video writer sink module (`-DUSE_VIDEOWRITER=ON`); the `Frame` capture API is
  unchanged.
- Pinned `videocapture` to `v0.4.0` (was `v0.3.0`), a breaking release for
  consumers: `VideoCaptureInterface::readFrame()` now fills a
  `videocapture::Frame` instead of a `cv::Mat`. `Frame` is dependency-free and
  carries an explicit pixel format, per-plane row strides, a presentation
  timestamp, and a sequence number. Video capture also no longer hangs at end
  of stream on the GStreamer backend, and `GStreamerOpenCV` was renamed to
  `GStreamerPipeline`.
  - Frames are bridged to OpenCV in one place, `neuriplo_infer::toBgrMat()`
    (`app/inc/FrameConversion.hpp`), rather than teaching every pipeline stage
    a second image type. For packed BGR8 -- what all three capture backends
    produce today -- the returned `cv::Mat` aliases the frame's own storage, so
    the common path copies nothing and the rendered overlay still lands in the
    frame's buffer. Other formats, including planar NV12 and YUV420P, are
    converted; a 4:2:0 frame whose layout is not the canonical packed one is
    rejected rather than reinterpreted.
  - The app no longer injects OpenCV into the fetched `VideoCapture` target.
    Up to v0.3.0 that was required, because `cv::Mat` was in the library's
    public API; since v0.4.0 OpenCV is internal to its OpenCV capture backend,
    which finds and links it itself. Keeping the injection would have put
    OpenCV back into the FFmpeg and GStreamer builds that release exists to
    free of it.
- **Breaking:** the capabilities document is now `schema_version` 2. It gained
  the required `diagnostics` section, and because the schema forbids unknown
  properties that is breaking in both directions; version 1 is preserved as
  `docs/capabilities.schema.v1.json`. Consumers should accept both and treat a
  version 1 document as a build that publishes no run report.
- Run diagnostics now cover the paths that do not go through `inferFrame`.
  Optical flow and image understanding time their own preprocess, inference,
  postprocess, and render stages and count their samples; video frame reads are
  attributed to the source stage and video rendering to the render stage; a
  completed video and a processed optical-flow pair each count as one sample.
- Warmup and benchmark iterations no longer contribute to the reported stage
  timings. They repeat inference without producing a sample, so their time
  inflated every stage total and collapsed `throughput_per_second`.
- A failure while constructing the application (log setup) now writes a
  configuration-stage report, like a failure while parsing arguments.
- A run report that cannot be flushed to disk is now detected and logged;
  `writeRunReport` returns whether the complete document was written. Only the
  open was checked before, so a full disk left truncated JSON behind silently.
- An unreadable image source now fails with an explicit error attributed to the
  source stage, instead of surfacing later as a confusing downstream failure.
  This now includes an optical-flow pair with an unreadable half, which was
  logged and skipped: the run exited 0 and reported success with no samples and
  no artifact, which a consumer cannot distinguish from having nothing to do.
- `throughput_per_second` is now `null` on a failed run. Counts are added only
  after work succeeds while the stage timer still records the attempt that
  threw, so the numerator and the denominator covered different work — the same
  mismatch already excluded for warmup and benchmark. The counts and the stage
  sums are still published; only the ratio is withheld.
- A video stopped early with `q` or Escape no longer counts as a completed
  sample. `samples` is documented as sources processed to completion, and an
  interrupted video is not one. Its frames still count, because they ran.
- `capabilities_cli_contract` now parses the emitted document and asserts the
  top-level `schema_version`. It matched a regular expression before, which the
  nested `diagnostics.run_report.schema_version` satisfied on its own, so the
  test would have passed whatever the capabilities version said.
- Pinned neuriplo-tasks to `v0.8.0` (was `v0.6.1`), picking up polygon
  segmentation output, the YOLO26 depth task, and the vision preprocessing
  fast paths.

### Removed
- `app/src/NeuriploInferProcessing.cpp` and `app/src/NeuriploInferRendering.cpp`,
  leftovers from the command refactor. They held second copies of the image,
  video, optical-flow, and image-understanding paths and of the per-task
  renderers, but were in no build target, referenced nowhere, and no longer
  compiled against their own headers. Their live counterparts are
  `CLICommands.cpp` and `ResultRenderer.cpp`. Uncompiled, they were invisible
  to every gate — formatting, lint, warnings, tests — while still reading like
  the code that runs, so a fix to one of these paths could land in the copy
  nothing executes. The run diagnostics were the concrete case: none of that
  duplicate processing code was instrumented.
- New `no_orphan_sources` test: a source under `app/src` that is named nowhere
  in `app/CMakeLists.txt` now fails the suite. Being excluded from a particular
  build (KServe, a backend) stays fine; being in no build at all does not.

## [0.9.1] - 2026-07-16

### Fixed
- EdgeCrafter export documentation links now appear inside their corresponding
  detection, segmentation, and pose supported-model subsections instead of
  after the generated model list.

### Changed
- Pinned neuriplo-tasks to `v0.6.1` for the canonical documentation source.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-07-15

### Changed
- Migrated application task boundaries from OpenCV types to native
  neuriplo-tasks vision images, sizes, and pixel types across image, video,
  optical-flow, image-understanding, warmup, and benchmark execution paths.
- Pinned neuriplo-tasks to `v0.6.0` and linked its optional
  `neuriplo-tasks::vision-opencv` adapter, keeping OpenCV isolated to the
  application boundary.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- RF-DETR keypoint pose routing. The CLI/E2E path now routes `rfdetrpose`,
  `rfdetr-pose`, `rfdetrkeypoint`, `rfdetr-keypoint`, `rfdetrkpt`, and
  `rfdetr-kpt` to `PoseEstimation`, mirroring the `RfDetrPose` family added in
  neuriplo-tasks v0.5.0.
- E2E runner preset for RF-DETR keypoint pose estimation.
- Windows (MSVC + vcpkg) build support.
- PR branch-policy workflow.

### Changed
- KServe remote-runtime client now defaults to the gRPC transport.
- Sibling pins: neuriplo-tasks v0.5.0, neuriplo v0.8.0,
  neuriplo-kserve-client v0.4.0, videocapture v0.3.0.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-06-14

### Added
- KServe output images are tagged with the backend the server actually used to
  run the model: `processed_<model>_kserve_<backend>.png` (rendered with a
  filename-safe separator, e.g. `processed_yolo26_kserve-litert.png`). The tag
  is derived from the KServe V2 metadata `platform` field surfaced by
  `KserveEngine` (`tensorrt_plan`->`trt`, `onnxruntime_onnx`->`ort`, `openvino`,
  `neuriplo_litert`->`litert`, ...); falls back to plain `kserve` when the
  server omits the platform.
- e2e example (`docker_run_inference_e2e_example.sh`): the EdgeCrafter presets
  can run on the `litert` backend, lowering the exported ONNX to TFLite via an
  `onnx2tf` conversion step (parallel to the TensorRT one). New
  `edgecrafter_det` litert dry-run in the e2e test.
- KServe + TFLite validated end-to-end locally (2026-06-13): the
  `neuriplo-kserve-runtime` litert backend serving a `.tflite` model, with the
  `neuriplo-infer` KServe client producing a rendered image.

### Changed
- Sibling release pins bumped: `neuriplo` v0.7.0 -> v0.8.0,
  `neuriplo-tasks` v0.4.0 -> v0.4.1, `neuriplo-kserve-client` v0.3.0 -> v0.4.0.

## [0.6.2] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- CLI output images are named `processed_<model>_<backend>.png` instead of a
  fixed `processed.png`, making multi-run local output easier to distinguish.

### Changed
- Sibling release pin bumped: `neuriplo` v0.6.0 -> v0.7.0 (tensor datatype
  metadata on `InferenceMetadata`). `videocapture` (v0.3.0), `neuriplo-tasks`
  (v0.4.0), and `neuriplo-kserve-client` (v0.3.0) unchanged.
- Compatibility matrix: `neuriplo-kserve-runtime` gRPC transport validated
  against the v0.2.0 runtime release (binary tensor framing and real tensor
  datatypes in model metadata).

### Removed
- Auto-publish GitHub Release workflow (`.github/workflows/publish-github-release.yml`);
  release notes are published manually after Release Guard validates sibling pins.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed
- `InferencePipelineBuilderTest` adapted to the neuriplo v0.6.0 load-failure
  contract: `setup_inference_engine` no longer lets vendor exceptions
  (e.g. `cv::Exception`) propagate -- it logs them and returns `nullptr`, so
  the builder's own `runtime_error` is now the expected failure shape for the
  intentionally-unparseable YOLO26 model under OpenCV 4.6. Fixes the red
  `master Release Check` / `develop CI` test jobs after the v0.6.0 release.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-06-12

### Changed
- Sibling release pins bumped: `neuriplo` v0.5.0 -> v0.6.0 (multi-backend
  builds, dlopen plugin ABI, raw typed-buffer output API) and
  `neuriplo-kserve-client` v0.1.0 -> v0.3.0 (proto profiles, gRPC
  raw-contents conformance). `videocapture` (v0.3.0) and `neuriplo-tasks`
  (v0.4.0) unchanged.
- Compatibility matrix: `neuriplo-kserve-runtime` gRPC transport is
  live-validated against the v0.1.0 runtime release
  (`raw_output_contents` emitted by default).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added
- KServe V2 remote runtime mode: run task preprocessing/postprocessing locally
  while sending inference tensors to a KServe V2 endpoint (`--kserve_endpoint`,
  `--kserve_model_name`, `--kserve_transport`, etc.), with HTTP and optional gRPC
  transport, TLS/mTLS, bearer auth, retry/backoff, keep-alive, binary tensor
  extension, readiness probing, and integration tests. See `docs/KserveRuntime.md`
  and `docs/KserveCompatibility.md`.
- KServe V2 Model Repository extension on the runtime client (now in
  `neuriplo-kserve-client`): `IClient` gains `repositoryIndex()` /
  `loadModel(name)` / `unloadModel(name)` as an optional capability (base methods
  throw; HTTP and gRPC clients implement them). HTTP POSTs
  `/v2/repository/index|models/{m}/load|models/{m}/unload`; gRPC adds the
  `RepositoryIndex` / `RepositoryModelLoad` / `RepositoryModelUnload` RPCs
  (field numbers matching the official KServe/Triton service). Pure path
  builders, the neutral `RepositoryModel` result, and `parseRepositoryIndex`
  are unit-tested; the calls reuse the existing retry/auth/TLS plumbing. See
  `docs/KserveRuntime.md`.

### Changed
- Closed out the KServe production roadmap: `feature/neuriplo-kserve-runtime`
  merged into `develop` (2026-06-09) with all phases complete. The roadmap doc
  was then transformed into `docs/KserveRuntime.md`, a reference for agents and
  humans (architecture, capabilities, configuration/env vars, build modes,
  testing); the historical gap tables and phase checklists were removed
  (CHANGELOG and git history keep the record). README and
  `docs/KserveCompatibility.md` updated to match actual capability (FP16/BF16
  over gRPC via the default raw tensor contents) and now document the
  `KSERVE_BINARY` and `KSERVE_MAX_RETRIES`/`KSERVE_RETRY_*` environment
  variables.
- Extracted the KServe V2 protocol client into a standalone sibling repository,
  [`neuriplo-kserve-client`](https://github.com/olibartfast/neuriplo-kserve-client)
  (the pure, backend-agnostic HTTP/gRPC client + proto + protocol/retry/security
  unit tests). neuriplo-infer now consumes it via `FetchContent`, pinned by
  `NEURIPLO_KSERVE_CLIENT_VERSION` in `versions.env` (`v0.1.0`) and governed by
  the same release tooling as the other siblings. Only the `KserveEngine`
  adapter (which bridges the client to the neuriplo inference contract) and its
  test remain in this repo. The library's gRPC-availability signal is the PUBLIC
  `KSERVE_CLIENT_WITH_GRPC` define (replaces the in-tree `NEURIPLO_INFER_WITH_GRPC`
  / `NEURIPLO_INFER_WITH_KSERVE_TLS` build flags).
- Removed the deprecated Acknowledgments section from `README.md`.

### Fixed
- CLI now exits cleanly when `--source` is missing instead of surfacing a
  confusing downstream error.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-06-07

### Changed
- Slimmed `README.md` and removed deprecated docs (`PROGRESS.md`,
  `docs/Roadmap.md`, `docs/FasterCompilationPlan.md`) and the deprecated local
  `ops/` compatibility pointer.
- Dropped the stale `neuriplo-tasks` branch pin in the OPENCV_DNN CI job.

### Fixed
- Removed the stale YOLO26 LiteRT Docker build override that pinned `neuriplo`
  to commit `8cf93e6`, so release builds use the `versions.env` pin
  `NEURIPLO_VERSION=v0.5.0` with the LiteRT NCHW→NHWC transpose fix.
- Moved LiteRT dependency setup before the full source copy in the Docker build
  so source-only changes do not force a TensorFlow Lite rebuild.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-06-07

### Changed
- Renamed application entry class to `NeuriploInfer` and aligned related
  source/test filenames with the `NeuriploInfer*` prefix.
- Renamed repository identity per ADR 0004: `neuriplo-infer` CMake project,
  static library, and executable output name, sibling pin
  `NEURIPLO_TASKS_VERSION`, and consumer updates for `neuriplo-tasks`
  includes/namespaces/link targets. The GitHub repo rename
  (`vision-inference` → `neuriplo-infer`) and the `vision-core` →
  `neuriplo-tasks` rename are both complete; FetchContent and the release
  scripts now track the renamed repos directly and the legacy compat shims
  were removed.
- Pinned `neuriplo` to `v0.5.0` (Abstract-Factory backend features),
  `neuriplo-tasks` to `v0.4.0`, and `videocapture` to `v0.3.0`.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-05-28

### Changed
- Pinned `neuriplo` to `v0.4.0` (LiteRT NCHW→NHWC transpose fix, new LiteRT
  backend) and `neuriplo-tasks` to `v0.3.2` (YOLO26 normalized coordinate scaling
  fix). `videocapture` pin unchanged at `v0.2.0`.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-05-21

### Changed
- Pinned `neuriplo-tasks` to `v0.3.1` in `versions.env` (README ↔ TaskFactory contract fixes and test hardening; no API change). `neuriplo` and `videocapture` pins unchanged.
- Re-synced `README.md` and `docs/generated/supported-model-types.md` from neuriplo-tasks v0.3.1's model-type block

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-21

### Added
- Gemma4 VLM image understanding wired via llama.cpp + libmtmd
- Grounding DINO open-vocabulary detection wired as `OpenVocabDetection` with BERT tokenizer support
- Multimodal CLI parameters and task routing
- VLM image understanding how-to and agentic wiring runbook

### Changed
- Sibling refs (`neuriplo`, `neuriplo-tasks`, `videocapture`) pinned in `versions.env` to each sibling's own release tag for reproducible tag checkouts; siblings now version independently
- Release tooling reworked for per-sibling pins: `cut_release.sh` detects each sibling's latest release tag, `validate_release_pins.sh` rejects branch-name pins (e.g. `master`/`develop`), enforced by the pre-push hook and the release-guard workflow
- Supported model types synced from neuriplo-tasks (adds ImageUnderstanding)
- CI skips on docs-only pushes; frees disk space before Docker builds

### Fixed
- Pre-push hook no longer runs `act` (no locally-runnable CI jobs for this repo)

## [0.2.3] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed
- Restored build dependency fetching through declared refs instead of relying on local sibling checkouts

## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-03

### Changed
- Derive the shared dependency ref inside CMake and release-aware tooling instead of carrying `DEPENDENCIES_VERSION` in `versions.env`
- Single source of truth for model types via sync script (`sync_supported_model_types.py`)
- Sync generated supported model types into `README.md` and `docs/generated/supported-model-types.md`
- Added `--check` dry-run mode to sync script for CI drift detection
- Added CI step to verify model-type docs are in sync after cmake configure
- Consolidated agent guidance into `AGENTS.md` and replaced helper instruction files with links to the canonical source
- Reduced duplicated documentation by rewriting architecture and dependency docs around canonical sources of truth

### Fixed
- Removed the stale hand-maintained compatibility matrix and replaced its remaining references with generated or code-owned sources

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- Dependency ref selection now follows the neuriplo-infer release line: `master` uses dependency `master`, all other branches use dependency `develop`
- Reject invalid `VERSION` contents early during CMake configure
- Require `--tokenizer_vocab` and `--tokenizer_merges` explicitly for open-vocabulary detection
- Include TensorFlow runtime libraries in the `libtensorflow` Docker runtime image
- Fix Docker E2E script TensorRT image naming and RAFT multi-frame input handling
- Fix CI backend version fetches for branch-specific dependency refs
- Fix Docker CI builds for LibTensorFlow, TensorRT, and OpenVINO on the release branch
- Honor explicit `DEPENDENCIES_VERSION` overrides in non-git build contexts such as Docker

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- TensorRT Docker build job in CI workflow
- OWLv2 open-vocabulary detection support (via neuriplo-tasks)
- Dependency branch ref validation in CMake (ensures neuriplo, videocapture, neuriplo-tasks target the same ref)

### Fixed
- CMake validation function name collision with neuriplo (renamed to `validate_project_dependencies`)
- Dockerfile.libtensorflow pip-based build and trailing newline issues
- Dependency ref resolution and GitHub Actions branch detection

### Changed
- Unified dependency versioning via `DEPENDENCIES_VERSION` in `versions.env` (replaces per-library version pins)
- CI workflow targets `develop` branch instead of `main`/`master`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added
- Confidence, NMS, and mask threshold CLI flags (`--confidence`, `--nms`, `--mask_threshold`)
- Threshold passthrough from CLI → `AppConfig` → `TaskConfig` → task constructors
- Depth estimation task support
- TensorRT precision option in inference scripts
- Docker end-to-end example scripts
- Composite GitHub Action to fetch neuriplo `versions.env`
- OpenVINO and LibTensorflow Docker CI builds
- GTest-based unit test suite (CLI parsing, threshold mapping, utils)
- Docker builds no longer depend on pre-existing `build/_deps/neuriplo-src/versions.env` (#15)
- Confidence/NMS/mask thresholds now correctly passed from CLI to task factory (#18)
